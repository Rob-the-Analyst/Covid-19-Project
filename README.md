# Covid-19 Vaccinations Exploration with Python and Power BI 

## 1. Projects Aims
### 1.1 Project Objectives.
This aim of this project is to develop a dashboard which displays key information about the global roll out of all vaccines administered to combat the Covid-19 virus. This dashboard will need to be updated regurarly to provide a continuous picture of key various key indicators. Key indicators will be chosen based on their relevance and statistical importance to someone seeking a broad picture of the vaccine roll-out. The tools that will be used for the project are Python, Excel and Power BI. 

### 1.2 Key Information Extracted. 
* 

### 1.3 Tools Used.
* **Python.** This will be used to scrape the data from the source and store as a csv for analysis. 
* **MS Excel.** This will be used to store the data and as the data source for Power BI. 
* **Power BI.** This will be used to extract the data in the stored excel files and to extract the data at regurlar intervals. 
* **Windows Task Manager**. This will be used to run the Python script at set times to regularly update the excel files.
