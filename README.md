# Covid-19 Vaccinations Exploration with Python, SQL, and Power BI 

## 1. Projects Aims
### 1.1 Project Overview.
This aim of this project was to develop a dashboard which displays key information about the global roll out of all vaccines administered to combat the Covid-19 virus. The dashboard is then updated regurarly to provide a continuous picture of various key indicators. Key indicators were chosen based on their relevance and statistical importance to someone seeking a broad picture of the vaccine roll-out. The tools that were used for the project are Python, Excel, Power BI, MySQL, and Windows Task Manager. 

### 1.2 Key Information Extracted. 
* 

### 1.3 Tools Used.
* **Python.** This is used to scrape the data from the source and store as a csv for analysis. 
* **MySQL.** This is used for preliminary exploration of the data to determine key information about the vaccine roll out. 
* **MS Excel.** This is used to store the data and use as the data source for Power BI. 
* **Power BI.** This is used to extract the data in the stored excel files and to extract the data at regurlar intervals. 
* **Windows Task Manager**. This is used to run the Python script at set times to regularly update the excel files.

## 2. Project Execution
### Steps Taken in the Project. 
1. The data source was chosen based on its comprehensiveness and reliability. *Data Source:* https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
2. A Python script was developed to extract the data source from the above link and store it as a csv file. 
3. Initial data exploration was carried out in SQL
